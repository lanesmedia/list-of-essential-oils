                                    How do you store essential oils?

                                                    <p>When we think of essential oil storage, we often think of dark, musty basements or attics. While these storage spaces can be ideal, they come with drawbacks. If you’re using them to store essential oils, you’ll be inhaling their pungent scents for days on end, exposing yourself to harmful bacteria and molds in the process. And if you’re using these spaces to store food, it’s probably worth investing in some air purifiers to remove the smell of your DIY projects from the rest of the house.The great thing about essential oil storage is that you don’t need to go to extremes to protect your precious oils from the elements. Here are some ways you can keep your essential oils safe and secure:</p><h2>Go for a wooden drawer</h2><p>If you have the space and the budget, a wooden drawer might be the best option for storing essential oils. Not only will it keep them out of direct sunlight, but it can also be locked to prevent children or pets from accessing them. However, wooden drawers are not the best option if you live in a humid climate. They’re also not very practical if you’re short on drawer space, and they can get pretty expensive.If you want to go for a more affordable option, you can try a metal or plastic drawer. They’re great for storing essential oils in a sunny room, as well as for pets and children.If you’re storing a wide range of essential oils, a drawer might not be the best option. You’ll want something that’s tall enough to accommodate the bottles without spilling, and something that’s able to retain moisture without absorbing it.</p><h2>Store your oil in a cool, dark drawer</h2><p>If you have some space that’s not exposed to the elements and ideal for storing essential oils, a cool, dark drawer is a great option. You can use a drawer for essential oil storage in a similar way to the wooden drawer above. You’ll want to consider how you want to organize the drawer, though. If you’re storing a wide range of essential oils, you may want to group them by scent family or family type.For example, if you’re storing tea tree essential oil, lemon essential oil, and lavender essential oil, you could group them under the family type of “floral.” This makes it easier to find the specific oil you’re looking for when you need it.</p><h2>Store essential oils in a dark, dry cabinet</h2><p>If you have a dark, dry cabinet that’s out of direct sunlight, it can be a great place for essential oil storage. However, you’ll want to make sure that cabinet is as dry as possible, particularly if you have some essential oils that are naturally very volatile.You can test your cabinet to make sure it’s dry by leaving a few drops of water and a few drops of your essential oil in a jar for a few days. If they both evaporate within a few days, they’re sufficiently dry.If your cabinet is particularly humid, you can buy a dehumidifier to dry it out. Alternatively, you can try storing your essential oils in a plastic storage container with a lid. This way, they’ll be isolated from the humidity in the rest of your cabinet.</p><h2>Store essential oils in a cool, dry cabinet</h2><p>If you have a cool, dry cabinet that’s out of direct sunlight, you can store your essential oils in that space. However, you’ll want to make sure you have a good cover for the cabinet.Some cabinets come with a blanket that you can use to protect the essential oils inside. Alternatively, you can buy a cabinet cover.A blanket or cover will keep dust and other particles out of your cabinet, as well as some of the sun’s UV rays. UV rays can damage essential oils and cause them to lose their scent.</p><h2>Bottle Storage</h2><p>If you have the space and the budget, you can store essential oils in bottles. This is particularly true if you use the oils frequently. If you’ve used up all the oil in the bottle, just pop in a new one.You can also store bottles of essential oils in a cabinet or drawer. A cabinet or drawer is a great place to store bottles, as they’ll be out of the way and won’t be in direct sunlight.You can also store bottles on a table, or somewhere else that’s out of the way. This way, you can pick up the bottle and easily grab the oil. If you have a bottle that’s made of glass, it can be a good idea to store it in a cool, dry cabinet. This way, it’ll be protected from the elements and retain the scent of the oil.If you have a plastic bottle, you can store the bottle near the essential oil drawer. This way, you don’t have to worry about spills damaging the drawer.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>When it comes to essential oil storage, there are many different ways to go. Whether you want to store them in a drawer, cabinet, or bottle, there are many options available. The best thing to do is to choose a storage method that’s best suited to your needs. Some of these methods are more practical than others. For example, storing essential oils in a dry drawer or cabinet that’s out of direct sunlight is a great option.However, if you live in a humid climate, you’ll want to use a wooden drawer or a cabinet. The wood will keep the essential oils protected from the elements. Similarly, if you have a bottle of essential oil, you can store it in a drawer or cabinet. However, you’ll want to make sure it’s not exposed to UV light.</p>
